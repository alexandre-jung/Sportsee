# Sportsee

Project 12 - Develop an analytics dashboard using React.

## 🚨 Prerequisites

### ⚠️ Node.js

 You must have [`Node 16`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed with `npm 8`.\
Higher versions should also work, though this has not been tested.

### 📝 Editor/IDE

I would recommend using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for developing this project.\
It's a full-featured JavaScript/TypeScript IDE, with a deep understanding of the code, and provides many tools for code
analysis, refactoring, etc. It also includes fist-class Git support, out-of-the-box.

But if you're looking for an alternative, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is also a good fit.

## 🏗️ Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/alexandre-jung/Sportsee.git
cd Sportsee/
npm install
```

## ⚡️ Start using mock data

To start the project in development mode, run:

```
npm start
```

You can delay the mock responses and view the nice placeholders by running instead:

```
npm run start:demo
```

## 🚀 Start using the API

Clone the backend and follow the instructions here:\
https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

Once the backend is up and running, run:

```
cd Sportsee/
npm run build
npm run preview
```
