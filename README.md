# Sportsee

Project 12 - Develop an analytics dashboard using React.

## Prerequisites

You must have [`Node 16`](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed with `npm`.\
Higher versions should also work, though this has not been tested.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/alexandre-jung/Sportsee.git
cd Sportsee/
npm install
```

## Start

To start the project in development mode, run:

```
npm start
```

You can delay the mock responses and view the nice placeholders by running instead:

```
npm run start:demo
```

## Start using the API

Clone the backend and follow the instructions here:\
https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

Once the backend is started, run:

```
npm run build
npm run preview
```
